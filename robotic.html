            <div class="about-robotic">
                <h5 class="about-text">Cybernet began its work in the development of robotics technology In the early 1990s.
                     The technology applied ranges in fields from computer gaming to augmented reality 
                     training to human intention-cued, automated multi-camera surveillance.<br><br>
                    Cybernet was an early developer of user interfaces to robotic and computerized 
                    devices based on detection of motion in video and inertial tracker data streams,
                     recognition of intentional human motion in these motion streams, and conversion
                    of the human intention into machine control or computer control commands. 
                    technology was popularized in computer gaming by Microsoft through its Kinect
                     product.<br><br>
                    To integrate complex automation systems, Cybernet works with a number of Detroit-based 
                    nontraditional robotics applications and manufacturing companies, allowing us to bring 
                    mature automotive-derived experience to our military customers for tactical and field 
                    applications. Leveraging material handling expertise available from this mature 
                    manufacturing sector, we use our military expertise to modify the designs of various 
                    COTS material handling systems to support our soldiers' needs in the field.

                    required to perform material handling missions,both as an operator
                    assist capability and as a fully autonomous operation.</h6>
